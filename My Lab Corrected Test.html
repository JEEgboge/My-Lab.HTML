   <h2>The story of Benedict Fabor</h2> 
Benedict Fabor was a 400L student of the Department of Geology, Delta State University, Abraka, Nigeria
    <a href="https://www.delsu.edu.ng/"> Official website of Delta State University</a>. He is from Ayakoromo in Burutu Local Government Area of Delta State. In 2002 he had to withdraw from studies for medical reasons while his admission was deferred for an academic session. According to his father, while he was away from school in thr year ge was away from school, they made a voyage to Ghana from the Seaport of Burutu in Nigeria. Along the way there was an accident that led to the boat capsizing.

    <p>
Mr. Fabor, Benedicts father had told his son,"Benedict, you cannot swim. Even though I can, I will not be able to rescue you because I am already aging. It is better one person survives than for both of us to die". Benedict accepted that the father should swim to safety. At this point water has reached chest level in the boat which was like some 100m from the fringe of the Atlantic coast. The father left him and swam to shore.

  <p>
Maj. Fabor, for he was an ex-serviceman from the Nigerian Army, stood watching the vortex that was now forming from the sinking boat and several persons strucggling with drowning to survive and those swimming to safety. Maj. Fabor never saw his son in the blue waters dotted by deminishing number of survivors swimming to safety. Something must have giving him a hope that his son would survive even though he must have felt like crying. he must have encouraged hi,self not to do so as men are not expected to cry in his Ijaw culture. Suddenly, he saw Benedict shouting daddy! daddy! daddy! and sunk into the water. This happened again and again and each time he observed Benedict was getting closer to the shore. Eventually Benedict stood on the shallow beach with the waters reaching just his neck. Immediately a dolphin came up beside him and waved his thrunk and head side to side. Benedicts father knew at this point that it was the dolphine that reascued his son. He said he knew from childhood that dolphines rescue people in danger at sea.

Maj. Fabor was however giving this narative on a day in September in a rather very sorrowful soliloquy, He had said, "So would this boy die after surving this accident?"<br>
    In <mark>August 16 of the year 2003</mark>, thirty-one students from different departments of Delta State University, Abraka(Delsu) was embarking on a journey to effect a condolence visit to the family of one Zipamo Miabebebo Donald of Ayakoromo Town who was killed by suspected Itsekiri militia when a passenger boat travelling to the Ijaw town of Bururtu was captured on June 24, 2003 and all but one of fifteen passengers escaped by jumping into the river.

    </p>
    <p>
07:30AM Nigerian time has been scheduled as depature time to proceed to Ayakoromo for the condolence visit to the family of Zipamo Mienbebebo Donald. Benedict Fabor was not to be in the bus; however he accompanied Saibakumor Governor who has indicated interest to make the journey. He was cajouled by Governor to accompany him and out of the 32 persons that made the journey, only the two of them did not return.
  </p>
  <p>
August 23, 2003, the National Union of Izon Students had sent three students ahead of the condolence visit to arrange for a boat that will ferry the students from Okwagbe an Urhobo language speaking town to Ayakoromo. This itinerary has been deemed safe by all as at a day earlier in a meeting by the Union as the route from Warri was unsafe due to the Ijaw-Itsekiri tribal war, that was at its climax, and which consumed Donald. The three students that were sent ahead of the journey arrived Okwagbe at in the midst of a new crises involving their tribe and the Urhobos at Okwagbe water side. This new crises was just building up on August 15 was initiated by a certain Businessman, John Togo and the Chairmain of the Okwagbe marine workers association.

  <h3>
The Okwagbe Waterside Crises
  </h3>
The chairman of the Okwagbe waterside workers union had rented a local cargo/passenger boat and refused to pay the owner who reported the issue to John Togo a dreaded militant. John Togo approached the Chairman to resolve the issue but the Chairman had rather had a misunderstanding with John Togo. Togo left only to return with some of his boys to capture the Chairman and some of the boys of the Chairman who had earlier casted aspersions on him. Five persons were so captured and taken to their camps. Togo saw a lumberer driving past in his boat returning from his craft and ordered the lumberer through gunshots into the air to submit his motorised saw. The Chairman was killed off the bank{shore) of Ogwagbe Harbour with a motor saw because bullets could not penetrate him. He was cut in two. John Togo took one of their captives saying that he would want to personally take that one to teach him a lesson because he had boasted that Togo cannot do him anything. Togos men took the other three men and went in downstream the river while Togo headed upstream to his militant camp. Along the way the Yamaya 200 Hp engine of Togo developed a fault and stopped. Trying to offer firsthand maintenance and get the engine kicking again and to prevent the tides from ferring him alone with the captive into Ogwagbe, he paddled the boat to the river bank and tied berthed the boat and continued troubleshooting leaving his riffle behind him. The captive quietly stretched his hand, cripped the SMG and as John Togo noticed and turned back, he fired a short at Togo lowing off half of one of his nostriles. Togo fell inside the boath and the captive escapped with Jpohn Togo's riffle mistaken him to have died. Togo's men were returning to camp when they sighted his boat and immediately noticed there was trouble. On closer inspection they saw their commader in a pool of his blood and rushed him for treatment in a private hospital claiming that he was injured at the war in Warri.
